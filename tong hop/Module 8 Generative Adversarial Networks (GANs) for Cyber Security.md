## **SLIDES M·ªöI - Ch√®n sau Slide 9**

### Slide 9A: GAN Training Challenges

**Title:** Common Challenges in GAN Training

**The Difficulty of Training GANs:**

**Mode Collapse**
‚Ä¢ Generator produces limited variety of outputs
‚Ä¢ All generated samples look similar
‚Ä¢ Example: Face generator only creates blonde females

**Vanishing Gradients**
‚Ä¢ Discriminator becomes too good too fast
‚Ä¢ Generator receives no useful learning signal
‚Ä¢ Training stalls with no improvement

**Non-Convergence**
‚Ä¢ Networks oscillate without reaching equilibrium
‚Ä¢ No stable solution found
‚Ä¢ Common in poorly designed architectures

**Training Instability**
‚Ä¢ Loss values fluctuate wildly
‚Ä¢ Difficult to determine when to stop training
‚Ä¢ Requires careful hyperparameter tuning

*Suggested Image: Graph showing unstable GAN training with oscillating loss curves, examples of mode collapse (similar faces)*

### Slide 9B: Solutions to GAN Training Problems

**Title:** Overcoming GAN Training Challenges

**Practical Solutions:**

**For Mode Collapse:**
‚Ä¢ Use **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** with gradient penalty
‚Ä¢ Implement **mini-batch discrimination**
‚Ä¢ Add **diversity loss terms** to objective function

**For Vanishing Gradients:**
‚Ä¢ Use **Least Squares GAN (LSGAN)** loss
‚Ä¢ Implement **progressive training** (start simple, add complexity)
‚Ä¢ Apply **spectral normalization** to discriminator

**For Instability:**
‚Ä¢ Use **two time-scale update rule (TTUR)**
‚Ä¢ Implement **batch normalization** carefully
‚Ä¢ Try **self-attention mechanisms** for better feature learning

**Best Practices:**
‚Ä¢ Monitor multiple metrics (not just loss)
‚Ä¢ Use learning rate scheduling
‚Ä¢ Save checkpoints frequently
‚Ä¢ Visualize outputs during training

## **SLIDES M·ªöI - Ch√®n sau Slide 25**

### Slide 25A: Evaluating GAN Performance

**Title:** How to Measure GAN Quality

**Visual Inspection (Qualitative):**
‚Ä¢ Human evaluation of generated samples
‚Ä¢ Compare with real data side-by-side
‚Ä¢ Check for artifacts, blurriness, unrealistic features

**Quantitative Metrics:**

**1. Inception Score (IS)**
‚Ä¢ Measures quality and diversity of generated images
‚Ä¢ Higher is better (typically 1-10 range)
‚Ä¢ Formula based on classifier confidence

**2. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)**
‚Ä¢ Compares distribution of generated vs. real data
‚Ä¢ Lower is better (0 = perfect match)
‚Ä¢ Current state-of-art GANs achieve FID < 5

**3. Precision and Recall for GANs**
‚Ä¢ Precision: Quality of generated samples
‚Ä¢ Recall: Diversity/coverage of real data distribution
‚Ä¢ Balanced scores indicate good GAN performance

**4. Perceptual Path Length (PPL)**
‚Ä¢ Measures smoothness of latent space
‚Ä¢ Lower values indicate better interpolation

**For Cybersecurity GANs:**
‚Ä¢ **Detection Rate:** How well IDS/classifier is fooled
‚Ä¢ **Functional Preservation:** Does malicious payload still work?
‚Ä¢ **Statistical Similarity:** KL divergence from real traffic

### Slide 25B: Common Training Errors and Debugging

**Title:** Troubleshooting GAN Training

**Error 1: GPU Out of Memory**
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Reduce batch size (try 16, 8, or even 4)
‚Ä¢ Use mixed precision training (FP16)
‚Ä¢ Clear cache: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
‚Ä¢ Use gradient accumulation

**Error 2: NaN or Inf Loss Values**
```
Loss: nan or inf
```
**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Check learning rate (try 0.0002 to 0.00001)
‚Ä¢ Add gradient clipping: `clip_grad_norm_()`
‚Ä¢ Check data normalization (-1 to 1 range)
‚Ä¢ Use stable activation functions (LeakyReLU)

**Error 3: Mode Collapse**
**Symptoms:** Generator produces same/similar outputs
**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Switch to Wasserstein GAN loss
‚Ä¢ Add noise to discriminator inputs
‚Ä¢ Use mini-batch discrimination
‚Ä¢ Try different architectures

**Error 4: Discriminator Too Strong**
**Symptoms:** Generator loss doesn't decrease
**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Train discriminator less frequently (1:5 ratio)
‚Ä¢ Add noise to real data
‚Ä¢ Use one-sided label smoothing (0.9 instead of 1.0)

**Error 5: Poor Quality Outputs**
**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Increase model capacity (more layers/filters)
‚Ä¢ Train longer (check if still improving)
‚Ä¢ Improve data quality and preprocessing
‚Ä¢ Try different loss functions

**Slide 5: What is a GAN?**

# Generative Adversarial Networks: The Basics

A GAN consists of two neural networks competing in a zero-sum game:
‚Ä¢ **Generator**: Creates fake data that mimics real data
‚Ä¢ **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake data
‚Ä¢ **Training Process**: Adversarial competition improves both networks
‚Ä¢ **End Goal**: Generator produces data indistinguishable from real data

*Suggested Image: Two chess players facing each other, one labeled "Generator" and one "Discriminator"*

**Slide 6: The Counterfeiter Analogy**

# Understanding GANs Through Analogy

**The Counterfeiter (Generator):** ‚Ä¢ Tries to create perfect fake money
‚Ä¢ Learns from detective's feedback
‚Ä¢ Improves techniques over time

**The Detective (Discriminator):** ‚Ä¢ Examines money to spot fakes
‚Ä¢ Gets better at detection with experience
‚Ä¢ Provides feedback to improve skills

**The Result:** Both become experts in their domains

```

**Where:** ‚Ä¢ x = real data samples
‚Ä¢ z = random noise input
‚Ä¢ G(z) = generated fake data
‚Ä¢ D(x) = discriminator's probability that x is real
‚Ä¢ The generator minimizes while discriminator maximizes

**Slide 16: Model Substitution Attack Theory**

# Network Attack via Model Substitution

**Core Concept:** Create a substitute model that mimics the target system's behavior, then use it to craft attacks.

**Why It Works:** ‚Ä¢ Many ML models have similar decision boundaries
‚Ä¢ Adversarial examples often transfer between models
‚Ä¢ Black-box systems can be probed and replicated

**Attack Vector:** Exploit the transferability of adversarial examples

*Suggested Image: Diagram showing original model being copied/substituted with arrows indicating attack flow*

**Slide 17: Model Substitution Process**

# The Attack Process - Step by Step

1. **Query Phase:** Send inputs to target system, collect responses
2. **Training Phase:** Train substitute model on collected data
3. **Generation Phase:** Create adversarial examples using substitute
4. **Transfer Phase:** Apply adversarial examples to original system
5. **Validation Phase:** Verify attack success

**Key Insight:** Substitute doesn't need to be perfect, just similar enough
