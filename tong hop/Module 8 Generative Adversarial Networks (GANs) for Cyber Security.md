**Slide 5: What is a GAN?**

# Generative Adversarial Networks: The Basics

A GAN consists of two neural networks competing in a zero-sum game:
• **Generator**: Creates fake data that mimics real data
• **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake data
• **Training Process**: Adversarial competition improves both networks
• **End Goal**: Generator produces data indistinguishable from real data

*Suggested Image: Two chess players facing each other, one labeled "Generator" and one "Discriminator"*

**Slide 6: The Counterfeiter Analogy**

# Understanding GANs Through Analogy

**The Counterfeiter (Generator):** • Tries to create perfect fake money
• Learns from detective's feedback
• Improves techniques over time

**The Detective (Discriminator):** • Examines money to spot fakes
• Gets better at detection with experience
• Provides feedback to improve skills

**The Result:** Both become experts in their domains

**Slide 7: GAN Architecture Diagram**

# Basic GAN Architecture

```
Random Noise → Generator → Fake Data
                    ↓
Real Data → Discriminator ← Fake Data
     ↓           ↓
   Real      Fake/Real
 (Label)    (Classification)
```

The generator learns to fool the discriminator
The discriminator learns to detect fakes better

**Slide 8: Mathematical Foundation**

# The Math Behind GANs

**Objective Function:**

```
min_G max_D V(D,G) = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1-D(G(z)))]
```

**Where:** • x = real data samples
• z = random noise input
• G(z) = generated fake data
• D(x) = discriminator's probability that x is real
• The generator minimizes while discriminator maximizes

**Slide 9: Training Process**

# How GANs Learn

**Phase 1 - Train Discriminator:** • Feed real data (label: 1)
• Feed fake data from generator (label: 0)
• Update discriminator weights

**Phase 2 - Train Generator:** • Generate fake data
• Try to fool discriminator (want label: 1)

**Repeat:** Until equilibrium is reached

• Adversarial examples often transfer between models
• Black-box systems can be probed and replicated

**Attack Vector:** Exploit the transferability of adversarial examples

3. **Generation Phase:** Create adversarial examples using substitute
4. **Transfer Phase:** Apply adversarial examples to original system
5. **Validation Phase:** Verify attack success

**Key Insight:** Substitute doesn't need to be perfect, just similar enough
