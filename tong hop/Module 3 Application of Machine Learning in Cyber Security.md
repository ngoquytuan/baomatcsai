### Slide 4: Train-Test Splitting - Introduction

**The Foundation of Reliable ML Models**

Train-test splitting prevents overfitting by:

- Using separate data for training and evaluation
- Simulating real-world performance
- Ensuring model generalization
- Validating security detection capabilities

Common split ratios: 70/30, 80/20, or 60/20/20 (train/test/validation)

*Suggested Image: Dataset being divided into train/test portions with pie chart*

### Slide 5: Train-Test Splitting - Why It Matters

**Overfitting: The Silent Killer**

**Overfitted Model:**

- Memorizes training data
- Fails on new attacks
- 99% accuracy on training, 60% on real threats

**Properly Split Model:**

- Learns general patterns
- Adapts to new attack variants
- Consistent performance across datasets

*Suggested Image: Graph showing overfitting curve vs proper generalization*

### Slide 6: Train-Test Splitting - Cybersecurity Example

**Malware Detection Scenario**

**Dataset:** 100,000 files (70,000 benign, 30,000 malicious) **Split:** 80,000 training, 20,000 testing

**Training Phase:** Model learns from 80,000 samples **Testing Phase:** Evaluate on unseen 20,000 samples **Result:** Realistic performance estimate for production deployment

### Slide 7: Train-Test Splitting - Implementation

**Python Code Example**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Network traffic features and attack labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    network_features, attack_labels,
    test_size=0.2,        # 20% for testing
    random_state=42,      # Reproducible results
    stratify=attack_labels # Maintain class distribution
)
```

### Slide 9: Data Standardization - Introduction

**Making Features Speak the Same Language**

Standardization transforms features to have:

- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1
- Equal scale across all features

Formula: z = (x - μ) / σ

*Suggested Image: Before/after comparison showing different scales normalized*

---

### Slide 10: Data Standardization - The Problem

**Scale Bias in ML Algorithms**

**Network Traffic Example:**

- Packet size: 64-1,500 bytes
- Duration: 0.1-3,600 seconds
- Packet count: 1-10,000 packets

Without standardization, algorithms focus only on largest values (packet count) and ignore important smaller-scale features.

*Suggested Image: Bar chart showing dramatically different feature scales*

---

### Slide 11: Data Standardization - Real-World Impact

**SOC Analysis Scenario**

**Before Standardization:**

- Model only considers high-volume metrics
- Misses subtle attack indicators
- High false negative rate

**After Standardization:**

- Equal weight to all security metrics
- Detects sophisticated, low-and-slow attacks
- Balanced threat detection

*Suggested Image: SOC analyst dashboard showing balanced vs unbalanced feature importance*

### Slide 12: Data Standardization - Attacker Perspective

**How Attackers Exploit Unstandardized Systems**

Sophisticated attackers:

- Study target system's ML models
- Manipulate high-scale features to mask attacks
- Keep low-scale suspicious activities hidden
- Exploit model's bias toward certain feature ranges

### Slide 13: Data Standardization - Implementation

**Python Code Example**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Initialize scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit on training data only
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform test data using training parameters
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Check results: mean ≈ 0, std ≈ 1
print(f"Mean: {X_train_scaled.mean()}")
print(f"Std: {X_train_scaled.std()}")
```

### Slide 17: PCA - Variance Explanation

**Choosing the Right Number of Components**

**Cumulative Variance Plot:**

- Component 1-5: 60% variance
- Component 1-10: 80% variance
- Component 1-20: 95% variance

**Decision Rule:** Choose components that explain 90-95% of variance

*Suggested Image: Cumulative variance plot/scree plot*

### Slide 18: PCA - Implementation Example

**Python Code**

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reduce from 100 to 20 components
pca = PCA(n_components=20)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_train_scaled)

# Analyze variance explained
plt.plot(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
plt.title('Variance Explained by Each Component')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component')
plt.ylabel('Variance Explained')

print(f"Total variance explained: {sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_):.2%}")
```

*Suggested Image: PCA variance plot with code snippet*

### Slide 19: PCA - Attacker Considerations

**Evasion Through Component Analysis**

**Attacker Strategy:**

- Analyze which features load onto minor components
- Manipulate less important features
- Stay hidden in "noise" dimensions
- Avoid detection in principal component space

**Defender Counter-Strategy:**

- Monitor minor components for systematic changes
- Use multiple PCA models with different parameters
- Combine with other detection methods

### Slide 20: Markov Chains - Introduction

**Predicting the Next State**

Markov Property: "The future depends only on the present, not the past"

**Text Generation:** Next word depends only on current word(s) **State Transition:** P(tomorrow | today, yesterday) = P(tomorrow | today)

*Suggested Image: Chain links or state transition diagram*

### Slide 21: Markov Chains - Text Generation Basics

**How It Works**

1. **Training:** Analyze text corpus for word transitions
2. **Model:** Build probability table of word pairs
3. **Generation:** Start with seed word, follow probability chains
4. **Output:** Statistically similar text to training data

**Example:** "security" → ["threat", "policy", "breach"] with probabilities

                          parse_dates=['timestamp'])
traffic_data.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)

# Seasonal decomposition

    traffic_data['requests_per_minute'],
    model='additive',
    period=24*60  # Daily pattern (minutes)
)

# Identify anomalies in residuals

    n_estimators=100
)

# Train on normal data
iso_forest.fit(normal_traffic_features)

# Detect anomalies in new data
anomaly_scores = iso_forest.decision_function(new_traffic)
anomaly_labels = iso_forest.predict(new_traffic)

# -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal
anomalies = new_traffic[anomaly_labels == -1]
print(f"Detected {len(anomalies)} anomalies")
```

### Slide 54: Key Takeaways and Best Practices

**Professional Security ML Guidelines**

1. **Always split data properly** - No peeking at test data
2. **Standardize features** - Equal importance to all metrics
3. **Use PCA wisely** - Balance dimensionality vs information loss
4. **Consider temporal patterns** - Time series analysis for evolving threats
5. **Embrace ensemble methods** - XGBoost often outperforms single algorithms
6. **Detect unknown unknowns** - Isolation Forest for novel threats
7. **Analyze text data** - NLP for human-generated threats
8. **Measure what matters** - Choose metrics based on business impact
9. **Iterate and improve** - Models must evolve with attack landscape
